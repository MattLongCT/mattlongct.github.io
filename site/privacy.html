		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<br />
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This Policy explains how I collect, use, and share your personal information.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I collect very little personal information about you.</li>

		</ul>
		<p>By using this site or by agreeing for the phone call reminder, you consent to this Policy.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Definitions</h2>

		<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
		<p>As mentioned <a href="../index.html#about">here</a>, this site is <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a>. It specifically uses a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages site">GitHub Pages</a> to host and provide content for you. As such, some things are just out of my control. Users should always make sure to review the relevant portions of <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages">GitHub's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
		<h2>What This Privacy Policy Does &amp; Doesn't Cover</h2>
			<p>Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.</p>
			<p>For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our major sites (found at <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Projects" title="m:Projects">list of major projects</a>), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.</li>
<li>Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).</li>
<li>Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.</li>
<li>Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.</li></ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the <a class="external text" href="https://shop.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Shop</a>) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on <a class="external text" href="https://labs.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Cloud Services</a>). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.</p><p><span id="More_On_What_This_Privacy_Policy_Doesn&#39;t_Cover"></p>
<h2>Collection &amp; Use of Info</h2>
<h3>Types of Information We Receive From You &amp; How We Get It</h3>
<h4>Metadata</h4>
<p>Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Metadata" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">metadata</a>, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.</p>

<h3>Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites</h3>


<p>We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p>Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit this site.</p>
<p>We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.</p>
<br />
<p>We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>

<h4>Information We Receive Automatically</h4>

<p>Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Browsers" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">browser</a>, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Operating_System" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">operating system</a>, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.</p>

<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<p>I use a commonly-used technology, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">a cookie</a> to make this website easier to use and see how many people .</p>
<p>We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Tracking_Pixel" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">tracking pixels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#JavaScript" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">JavaScript</a>, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Cookies" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">cookies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Local_Storage" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">local storage</a>. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.</p><p>Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal Information (like your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a>) and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).</p>
<p>We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. I use a some third-party cookies.</p>

<tbody><tr>
<th><div >More on Locally Stored Data
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:</p>
<ul><li>Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.</li>
<li>Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.</li>
<li>Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.</li>
<li>Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.</li>
<li>Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.</li></ul>

<h3>How Do We Protect Your Data?</h3>
<p>I use a variety of technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. I will basically try to not screw anything up, but please do not expect more than my own personal paranoia to get by here.</p>
<h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Data?</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with U.S. law.</p>
<p>Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. Non-personal information may be retained indefinitely. (Check out the list of examples in our <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/FAQ#datatimeexamplesFAQ" title="Privacy policy/FAQ">FAQ</a>.)</p><p><span id="rememberIPindef">
Please remember that certain information, such as your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a> (if you edit while not logged in) and any public contributions to the Wikimedia Sites, is archived and displayed indefinitely by design; the transparency of the projects’ contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our <a class="external text" href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines">data retention guidelines</a>. For further information about how you may request access to or deletion of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/FAQ#anonymize" title="Privacy policy/FAQ">FAQ</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.</p>

<p>Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on <a class="external text" href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l">WikimediaAnnounce-L</a> or a similar mailing list.</li>
	<li>For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via <a class="external text" href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l">WikimediaAnnounce-L</a> or similar mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our <a class="mw-selflink selflink">Privacy Policy</a>. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective, following notice as outlined above, constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.</p>
