<p>This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<dl><dt><big>Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies</big></dt>
<dd>Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:
<ul><li><b>Wikimedia Shop</b> (covered by <a class="external text" href="https://shop.wikimedia.org/pages/privacy-policy">the shop's policy</a>);</li>
<li><b>donate.wikimedia.org</b>, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by <a href="/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Donor_policy" title="Special:MyLanguage/Donor policy">the Donor Privacy Policy</a>); and</li>
<li><b>the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Synced_Reading_Lists" title="mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists">Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension</a></b>, which is governed by a separate <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_Reading_Lists_Browser_Extension_Privacy_Policy" title="Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><big>Community members</big></dt>
<dd>The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. As a result, some volunteers have access to certain Personal Information, and use of that Personal Information may not be governed by this Privacy Policy. Volunteers that have such access include:
<ul><li><b>Administrative volunteers</b>, such as <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/CheckUser" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/CheckUser">CheckUsers</a> or <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Stewards" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/Stewards">Stewards</a>. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Access_to_nonpublic_information_policy" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/Access to nonpublic information policy">Access to Nonpublic Information Policy</a>, as well as other, tool-specific policies.</li>
<li><b>Tool providers</b>. Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as <a class="external text" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Cloud_Services">wmflabs.org</a>.  When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.</li>
<li><b>Other users</b>. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
<ul><li>posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;</li>
<li>requesting support from volunteers through our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/OTRS" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/OTRS">online ticketing system</a> (email sent to info[at]wikimedia.org goes to this system);</li>
<li>emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and</li>
<li>chatting on <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/IRC" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/IRC">IRC</a> (such as on the #wikipedia channel).</li></ul></li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dt><big>Third parties</big></dt>
<dd>This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:
<ul><li><b>Websites run by other organizations</b>, like websites linked to from the “References” sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other <a href="/wiki/Resolution:Recognizing_Models_of_Affiliations" title="Resolution:Recognizing Models of Affiliations">movement organizations</a>. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
<li><b>Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals</b>. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy[at]wikimedia.org so we can investigate.</p>

<p>Where community policies govern information, such as the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_policy" title="m:CheckUser policy">CheckUser policy</a>, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.</p><p><span id="use"></p>

<p>To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you don't want to, you don't have to—it's as simple as that.</p>

</div>

<p>We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p>Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit this site.</p>
<p>We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.</p>
<br />
<p>We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>

<p><span id="info-received-automatically"></p>
<h4>Information We Receive Automatically</h4>

<p>Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Browsers" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">browser</a>, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Operating_System" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">operating system</a>, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.</p>

<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.</p><p>Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal Information (like your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a>) and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).</p><p>We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services.

We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.</p><p>Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites.
