			<br />
			<h2>Definitions</h2>

			<h2>Applicibility</h2>
			<p>Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.</p>
			<p>For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:</p>
			<br />	
			<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
			<p>As mentioned <a href="../index.html#about">here</a>, this site is <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a>. It specifically uses a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages site">GitHub Pages</a> to host and provide content for you. As such, some things are just out of my control. Users should always make sure to review the relevant portions of <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages">GitHub's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Collection</h2>
			<p>I use a commonly-used technology, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">a cookie</a> to make this website easier to use and see how many people .</p>
			<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
			<p>We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>
			<h2>Policy Changes</h2>
			<p>All changes to this Privacy Policy can be <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">tracked using GitHub</a>.</p>
			<p>Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure this Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:</p>
			<p>I ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the site after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Attribution</h2>
			<p>This Privacy Policy is derived from the <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Privacy_policy&amp;oldid=118373">Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Questions</h2>
			<p>I have no clue how to give you <a href="../index.html#contact" title="Main site">my contact information</a> without you consenting to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, you are free to try to reach out to me...</p>
			<p>It beats me how you are going to do that without using this website, though. That sounds like a Catch-22.</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Thank You!</h2>
			<p>Thank you for reading my Privacy Policy. I hope you enjoy using this website and appreciate your interest in my campaign. to help improve Cromwell.</p>
