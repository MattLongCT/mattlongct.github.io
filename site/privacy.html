				<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
				<p>As mentioned <a href="../index.html#about">here</a>, this site is <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a>. It specifically uses a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages site">GitHub Pages</a> to host and provide content for you. As such, some things are just out of my control. Users should always make sure to review the relevant portions of <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement#github-pages">GitHub's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

				<h2>Phone Call Reminder</h2>
				<p>While in public, I may ask potential voters if they would like to receive a Phone Call Reminder. These individuals should have received a business card with a link to the website for notice of this Privacy Policy, but it is pretty straight forward though.</p>
				<p>You may also opt-in to receive the Reminder through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEOcTmiE28keYuOAdCIMORDFM_Wpp-OdVBYi_ZUP-v-ooK3w/viewform">this online form</a>.</p>
				<p>On 4 November 2019, I plan on making calls to the provided numbers. If there is no answer, they I will try to leave a voicemail and send a text message. The device used for this purpose may be a shared family phone.</p>
				<p>Information collected for the Phone Call Reminder includes a voter's (your) address, zip code, first name, and phone number.</p>

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>I use a standard technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> to make this website more accessible and view statistics on website traffic.</p>
				<p>This information will then be used to enhance your experience with this site.</p>
				<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
				<p>It is worth mentioning that the cookies used are provided through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a>, so some of the cookies are from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third-party_cookies">third party</a>. I have tried to keep it as minimally invasive as possible, and I have only opted-in to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2992042?hl=en&utm_id=ad">Users Metric in Reporting</a>.

				<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
				<p>I keep all information related to your information confidential, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>I will try to never <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snitch#Verb">snitch</a> on you if you comply with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">non-aggression principle (NAP)</a>. However, if I get a legit court order or something, do expect me to follow it.</p>
				<p>Some information may also be shared with some members of my family. As I continue running for office, I lean on them for advice and such.</p>
				<p>I do reserve the right to transfer any non-personally identifiable information to the Libertarian Party of Connecticut or any affilated organization. I am unsure if this will even be something I would want to do in the future.</p>
				<p>I will never try to profit off your data including through its sale or rental.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="privacy">
				<h2>Data Retention</h2>
				<p>Any personally identifiable information collected incidentally will likely not be kept longer than needed.</p>
				<p>If I seem to not know anything about you, it could be because I deleted all your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. If I forget your birthday, it's because your privacy is just too important to me.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="privacy">
				<h2>Policy Changes</h2>
				<p>All changes to this Privacy Policy can be <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">tracked using GitHub</a>.</p>
				<p>I ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the site after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.</p>

				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<p>I have no clue how to give you <a href="../index.html#contact" title="Main site">my contact information</a> without you consenting to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, you are free to try to reach out to me...</p>
				<p>It beats me how you are going to do that without using this website, though. That sounds like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">Catch-22</a>.</p>

				<h2>Thank You!</h2>
