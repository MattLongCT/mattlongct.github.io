		<h1>My Record</h1>
		<p class="subheader">Three Key Values</p>
		<h2>Fairness</h2>
		<p>Every decision I made in my time on the board has come from a place of wanting to ensure everyone is treated fairly. I have asked thousands of questions, reviewed hundreds of pages of evidence, and spent many hours carefully deliberating all decisions.</p>
		<h2>Openess</h2>
		<p>On the board, I requested that all meeting minutes be made publicly available online. Tax payers are no longer kept in the dark about board decisions and can review every vote and important discussion we hold.</p>
		<h2>Accessibility</h2>
		<p>I have fought to ensure that the process is as painless as possible. In my time on the board, we implemented the two-year rule for vehicle appeals. Taxpayers who are granted a lower car assessment will now never have to worry about their valuation going up the next year.</p>

	<div class="about">
		<h1>The Website</h1>
		<p>The website is a work in progress.</p>
		<p>My goal in this campaign is to spend as little money as possible. This is a low-budget, cost-effective, and ruthlessly simple strategy to get my message out. Everything here is coming directly from me. Hopefully, I will be able to set aside time to make improvements here and there even still.</p>
		<p>The black background with white text is an intentional choice. It saves energy for the device you are reading this on.</p>
		<p>Finally, everything you see here is open-source and <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a>. Feel free to suggest changes there if you are so inclined.</p>
		<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
