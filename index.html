			<h1>My Record</h1>
			<p class="subheader">Three Key Values</p>
			<h2>Fairness</h2>
			<p>Every decision I made in my time on the board has come from a place of wanting to ensure everyone is treated fairly. I have asked thousands of questions, reviewed hundreds of pages of evidence, and spent many hours carefully deliberating all decisions.</p>
			<h2>Openness</h2>
			<p>On the board, I requested that all meeting minutes be made publicly available online. Tax payers are no longer kept in the dark about board decisions and can review every vote and important discussion we hold.</p>
			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>I have fought to ensure that the process is as painless as possible. In my time on the board, we implemented the two-year rule for vehicle appeals. Taxpayers who are granted a lower car assessment will now never have to worry about their valuation going up the next year.</p>

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I graduated from Cromwell High School with the class of 2016. Currently, I am a full time student at Middlesex Community College studying political science. My graduation will be in December. I am still figuring things out as it relates to moving on towards a four-year degree with financing, scheduling, and the like.</p>
			<p>At Middlesex, I have had the chance to serve in several important roles including (at various times) Secretary, Vice President, and a member of Student Senate, college representative for the statewide Student Advisory Committee to the Board of Regents, and student member of the Foundation Board. I recently had to resign all of these positions to focus on school and this campaign though, but I would love to come back after November 5th.</p>
			<p>This summer, I was elected to the <a href="http://www.oxfordparkct.com/index.php/homepage/board-of-directors">Oxford Park Community Association Board of Directors</a> for a term ending in 2022. Please, do feel free to reach out to me about that if you are a resident and have any questions or concerns needing to be addressed by the board.</p>
			<p>None of this campaign would be possible without my amazing mother. She raised two sets of twin pretty much by herself, and her support for me being active in politics is what makes this all possible.</p>

			<h1>The Website</h1>
			<p>The website has been lovingly crafted by hand, so everything really is a work in progress.</p>
			<p>This is a low-budget, cost-effective, and ruthlessly simple strategy to get my message out. Everything here is coming directly from me. Hopefully, I will be able to set aside time to make improvements here and there even still.</p>
			<p>The black background with white text is an intentional choice. It saves energy for the device you are reading this on.</p>
			<p>Everything you see here is open-source and <a href="https://github.com/MattLongCT/mattlongct.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a>. Feel free to suggest changes there if you are so inclined.</p>
